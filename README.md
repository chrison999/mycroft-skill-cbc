# mycroft-skill-cbc-news
A skill my MycroftAI that plays the latest cbc (Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation) news

## DESCRIPTION:

This Mycroft skill is a modification of the npr-skill by jdorleans.
Basically, all I have done is changed the URL from the latest NPR
news feed to CBC Radio's latest news feed.

## CURRENT STATE:

Works great!

## USAGE:

Say any of the following:

  * cbc news
  * tell me cbc news
  * listen to cbc news

##### NOTE:

Apparently CBC News Radio pulls the last "latest news" URL at the top of
the hour and then there is a few minutes delay before the new URL
appears.  This means that if you use this skill at the top of the hour
it may fail if the new URL isn't available.  This is *not* a bug with
this skill...  it's just the way Fox News Radio does things.
